# Introduction

Below are two links to a mock dataset that we can learn with during the RStudio and R package workshop series. 

# The Experiment

The mock data represents data from an experiment we conducted to evaluate the cumulative effects of drought and pathogen infeciton on an endemic and endangered species. 

![Silver Tree Trial](./Images/Silver Trees.jpg)

Trees were split into trails and treatments and infected with one of two pathogen species. We also included controls that were not inoculated. Below is a quick summary of the experimental design. 

```{r include=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("Silver Tree Study.csv")
summary <- data %>% filter(Species!="Both Pathogens") %>% group_by(Trial,Treatment,Species) %>% summarise("Number of Plants"=n_distinct(Plant.Number))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(summary,align='c')
```

We will learn to produce summary tables like the one above in [Session 3-Introduction to dplyr](http://jmhulbert.github.io/r/fabi/s3).

We measured the physiological response of the plants using some fancy equipment. At least 10 measurements were made on each plant 2-3 times a week for one month.

# Vegan Session Data

 * Below is a sample dataset that we will use for [Session 4](http://jmhulbert.github.io/r/fabi/s4).
